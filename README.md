# 🚀 AWS S3 Terraform Module Lab

---

## 🧠 Project Story

This project started as a multi-cloud infrastructure lab designed to compare AWS S3 with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Object Storage.

During the build, OCI account access became a blocker, so the project was pivoted into a clean AWS-first Terraform deployment while preserving the OCI module as a future extension.

The final version demonstrates a real Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) workflow using Terraform to provision an AWS S3 bucket with a modular project structure, reusable variables, tagging, outputs, validation, deployment proof, and GitHub documentation.

---

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

Cloud engineers are expected to do more than click through the console.

This project demonstrates how infrastructure can be:

* defined as code
* validated before deployment
* deployed consistently
* documented with proof
* structured for future expansion

The goal was not only to create an S3 bucket, but to build the project in a way that reflects real cloud engineering practices.

---

## 💼 Practical Impact

This project demonstrates the ability to:

* Build production-style infrastructure using Terraform modules
* Maintain clean separation between configuration and reusable components
* Validate infrastructure before deployment to prevent issues
* Ensure infrastructure consistency using Terraform state and drift detection
* Follow secure Git practices by excluding sensitive files

These are core skills required for Cloud Support Engineer and Junior Cloud Engineer roles in real-world environments.

## ⚙️ Deployment Steps

```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

---

## ✅ Deployment Result

* AWS S3 bucket successfully created via Terraform
* Outputs generated:

  * Bucket Name
  * Bucket ARN

Example:

```
aws_s3_bucket_name = "him-aws-to-oci-lab-dev-001"
aws_s3_bucket_arn  = "arn:aws:s3:::him-aws-to-oci-lab-dev-001"
```

## 📸 Proof (Screenshots)

Located in:

```

```

Includes:

* Terraform init / validate / apply
* S3 bucket creation in AWS Console
* Module structure and configuration

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

The following are intentionally excluded from version control:

* `.terraform/`
* `terraform.tfstate`
* `terraform.tfvars`

This follows Terraform and Git best practices for protecting sensitive data.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Enable OCI Object Storage module once account access is available
* Add remote backend (S3 + DynamoDB) for state management
* Implement CI/CD pipeline for Terraform deployment
* Add versioning, encryption, and lifecycle policies to S3 bucket
